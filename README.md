# Adventures in Python Kanren
Explorations in logic programming in Python using Kanren.  Based on a number of Prolog logic programming exercises.

Current examples were originally drawn from:

- https://github.com/MNoorFawi/logic-programming-in-python
- https://github.com/Pravinraja/Python-Kanren-Test
- https://github.com/Glushiator/kanren-family-excercise

Main changes to each were changing facts and other kanren goals (run, membero, . . .  ) from tuples to callable goals.

Current version on kanren is 1.0.5
